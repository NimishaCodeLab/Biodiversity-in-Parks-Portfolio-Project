    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this project will be performed analyzing, cleaning up, and ploting data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which species were spotted the most at each park?\n",
    "- Which park has the highest and the lowest number of mammals?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional."

    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "Most fof the time it is helpfull to screat a Scope of work and anilize each step for better performing. \n",
    "Four sections were created below to help guide the project's process and progress. \n",
    "The first section is the project goals, this section will define the high-level objectives and set the goals for this project. The next section is the data, data for the current project is already provided but still needs to be checked if project goals can be met with the available data. Third section is analysis will have to be thought through, which include the methods and questions that are aligned with the project goals. Lastly, the forth sectiion evaluation will help us build conclusions and findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be going through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "2. Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "3. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "4. Which species were spotted the most at each park?\n",
    "5. Which park has the highest and the lowest number of mammals?\n",
    "6. Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file contains data about different species and their conservation status; and second holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project and answer on the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. counts\n",
    "1. relationship between species\n",
    "1. conservation status of species\n",
    "1. observations of species in parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies."

    "Our scientists know that 15% of sheep at Bryce National Park have foot and mouth disease. Park rangers at Yellowstone National Park have been running a program to reduce the rate of foot and mouth disease at that park. The scientists want to test whether or not this program is working. They want to be able to detect reductions of at least 5 percentage point. For instance, if 10% of sheep in Yellowstone have foot and mouth disease, they'd like to be able to know this, with confidence.\n",
